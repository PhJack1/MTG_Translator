## 📦 Installation

### From Firefox Add-ons (coming soon)
*(Awaiting publication)*

### Manual installation (developers)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhJack1/MTG_Translator.git
cd MTG_Translator
```

2. In Firefox:
   - Type `about:debugging` in the address bar
   - Click "This Firefox" in the left menu
   - Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the `manifest.json` file in the project folder

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Select your language**: Click the extension icon and choose your target language from the available flags

2. **Translate a page**: 
   - Visit a supported site (e.g., mtgtop8.com)
   - Click the "Translate cards on page" button
   - Card names are instantly translated!

3. **View original name**: Hover over a translated card with your mouse to temporarily display its English name

4. **Add a manual translation**:
   - Enter the English name in the first field
   - Enter the translation in the second field
   - Click "Save"

5. **Export/Import your database**:
   - **Export**: Download your translation database as JSON
   - **Import**: Drag and drop a JSON file to merge translations

### 🤖 Automatic Translation
The extension can now automatically translate MTG cards without manual intervention. Simply check the "Automatic translation" checkbox in the popup and select your target language. Translation will occur automatically when each supported page loads and will also detect dynamic DOM changes (sites like Moxfield with live editing).

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Manifest V2** (Firefox)
- **JavaScript modules (ES6)**
- **IndexedDB** for local caching
- **Scryfall API** for translations

### Project Structure
```

│   ├── popup.html         # User interface

```

### How it works

1. **Detection**: Content script identifies elements containing card names via site-specific CSS selectors
2. **Local cache**: Checks if translation exists in IndexedDB
3. **Scryfall API**: If absent, queries Scryfall (rate-limited to ~10 req/s)
4. **Caching**: Stores new translation locally
5. **Display**: Replaces text in DOM with hover management

## 🛠️ Adding a New Site

The extension supports any website by adding CSS selectors to `assets/selectors.json`. This file maps website domains to the HTML elements containing card names.

### Selectors Configuration

Each site entry requires:
- **selector**: CSS selector targeting the element containing the card name
- **childIndex** (optional): If the card name is in a child element, specify which child (0 = first)
- **mode** (optional): Use `"composite"` for complex structures with parent and child selectors

### Basic Example

```json
{
  "new-site.com": [
    {
      "selector": "css-selector-for-cards",
      "childIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Composite Example (like Moxfield)

For sites with nested structures:

```json
{
  "moxfield.com": [
    {
      "selector": "a.table-deck-row-link.text-body",
      "mode": "composite",
      "childSelector": "span.underline"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Steps to Add a Site

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Inspect a card name element to find its CSS selector
3. Add an entry to `assets/selectors.json` with the selector
4. Test by reloading the extension and visiting the site
5. Refine the selector if needed

See `assets/selectors.json` for current supported sites and their configurations.
